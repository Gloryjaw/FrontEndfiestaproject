## Project Overview

The Frontend FISTA project focuses on developing the user interface and user experience for a gaming website. The purpose of this website is to provide a platform for gamers to explore and engage with various games, including game reviews, updates, and community features. The website will be designed to be visually appealing, intuitive, and responsive.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
https://github.com/devjayswal/FrontEndfiestaproject.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd frontend-fista

3. Install the project dependencies:

npm install
npm start


This command will start a local development server and open the website in your default browser. You can make changes to the code, and the browser will automatically reload to reflect the latest changes.

During development, you will primarily work with the following directories and files:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the website.
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable components used throughout the website.
- `src/pages/`: Contains individual page components.
- `src/styles/`: Contains CSS stylesheets for the website.
- `src/assets/`: Contains static assets such as images and icons.

Feel free to explore and modify these files to customize the website as per your requirements.
